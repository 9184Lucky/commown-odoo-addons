Use Cases / Context
===================

This module does not do a lot by itself and is mostly a dependency of
applications that allow your portal customers to manage their company's
objects (employees, sale orders, contracts or the like).

Usage
=====

To use this module you need to allow at least one portal user of each
customer company to access the company's sale orders and invoices. To do
this, go to the company's partner page and click the "Allow management
by the customer" button.

Then edit the company, navigate to the "Managers" tab, and add the
customer accounting group to the employees you want to be able to access
the above-mentionned documents.
