To use this module you need to allow at least one portal user of each customer company
to access the company's sale orders and invoices. To do this, go to the company's
partner page and click the "Allow management by the customer" button.

Then edit the company, navigate to the "Managers" tab, and add the customer accounting
group to the employees you want to be able to access the above-mentionned documents.
